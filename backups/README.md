Crome extensions need to be loaded from your own computer if not on the Chrome store. This is an easy way to make changes and store backups. ```chrome://extensions```  
load unpacked

Work on the extension off-line while copying the entire folder, then when it works load the whole folder back here. When it is fully tested   
move the files to the main part of the repository. quck and easy and allows going back to solve   errors.
